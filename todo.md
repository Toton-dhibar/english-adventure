# English Learning Website Development Plan

## Phase 1: Design Flashcard Generation Engine & Content Progression (Current: Step 003)

-   [X] Research and define content structure based on "Oxford's English translation book's levels" for beginner, intermediate, and advanced stages.
-   [X] Design the architecture for the flashcard generation engine.
    -   [X] Define data structure for flashcards (sentence, detailed info, visual cues/description, audio placeholder, level, sub-level).
    -   [X] Outline a strategy for programmatic/AI-assisted sentence generation aligned with defined levels and native expressions for advanced stages.
    -   [X] Outline a strategy for generating descriptions or prompts for anime-style static illustrations..
    -   [X] Plan integration of Text-to-Speech (TTS) for audio..
-   [X] Design the content progression logic..
    -   [X] Define how users progress through levels (e.g., number of cards to master, time-based progression).
    -   [X] Specify how "detailed information" will be structured and presented for advanced flashcards..
-   [X] Document the design choices for the flashcard engine and content progression..

## Phase 2: Implementation (Steps 004-005)

-   [X] Implement core UI components for the flashcard display..
-   [X] Implement swipe (left for details, right for next) functionality..
-   [X] Implement the flashcard generation engine (initial version with placeholder/limited content).
    -   [X] Develop sentence generation module (basic).
    -   [X] Integrate placeholder image generation/sourcing..
    -   [X] Integrate TTS for audio..
-   [X] Implement user level selection on first visit..
-   [X] Implement user progress persistence using browser local storage..
-   [X] Develop the "animated journey" theme elements (backgrounds, UI styling).

## Phase 3: Content Scaling & Refinement (Covered in later steps)

-   [ ] Scale up sentence generation for all levels.
-   [ ] Refine visual generation/sourcing process for anime-style illustrations.
-   [ ] Implement subtle animated effects for illustrations.
-   [ ] Develop detailed information content for advanced cards.

## Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Step 006)

-   [X] Conduct thorough testing of all features..
-   [X] Optimize for performance, especially with large content sets..
-   [X] Test on various devices and browsers..

## Phase 5: Validation & Finalization (Step 007-008)

-   [X] Validate site quality, engagement, and animation against user requirements..
-   [X] Prepare final site code and assets..
-   [X] Report and deliver the final site to the user..
